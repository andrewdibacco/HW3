            In general, I am a big fan of the fantasy/sci-fi genres in movies. Of these movies the Lord of the Rings adaptaion form the early 2000s is my favorite. I usually make it a point to marathon all three extended editions (approximately 12 hr. run-time) every few years or so. This past year, we invited several frineds and actually cooked dishes inspired by the movie to serve throughout the day.

            My favorite musical group is an indie rock band called Deerhunter. Their frontman, Bradford Cox, is very eccentric and has been known to wear wigs and clothes that could have only been find in thrift stores. Although their albums tend so be quiet and relaxing, their live presence is almost the complete opposite. I have seen Deerhunter perform live on four separate occassions, and each time I have left the venue slightly harder of hearing.

            Among other things, I believe cooking is one of the most essential skills to learn. For the past couple years, I usually will prepare a home cooked meal 2-3 times in a week. A few of my favorite dishes to cook include chicken picatta, Italian meatballs, and breaded pork loin. The best part about cooking is being able to bring people together to enjoy a nice meal and conversation.
